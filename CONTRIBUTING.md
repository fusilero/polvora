## Uncrustify
The code is formated through uncrustify. It's not perfect but it works 90% of the time so I use it.
In order to make it simple for me I use the script found [here](https://gist.github.com/steveno/32f098abb6d08e34da29ba182a93705e).
You only need to make sure you're one directory above polvora when you do.
